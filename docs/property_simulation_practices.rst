Property Specific Calculation Practices
======================================

Neat Liquid Densities
-------

Method of Calculation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Densities are calculated based on the formula :math:`\frac{M}{\langle V \rangle}`, where \langle V \rangle is the timeseries average of the total volume of the simulation. 

Simulations Required
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To compute the liquid density, a single neat liquid NPT simulation at the temperature and pressure (T,P) is required.

Relative Uncertainty Targets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For this property, we choose a relative uncertainty target of 0.1% (i.e. 1000+-1).  This choice is based on....
