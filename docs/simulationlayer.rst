The ``SimulationLayer``
========================

The ``SimulationLayer`` is a calculation which employs molecular simulation to estimate data sets of physical
properties. It inherits the ``WorkflowflowLayer``, and makes use of per property workflows defined in the
``SimulationLayerSchema`` to run the simulations.
